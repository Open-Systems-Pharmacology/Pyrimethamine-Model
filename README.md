# Pyrimethamine-Model
Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling of Pyrimethamine as Inhibitor of OCT2 and MATE1

## Repository Files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of pyrimethamine. The model has been developed and evaluated for the prediction of pyrimethamine plasma concentrations and amount excreted to urine after oral administration over a wide dose range (12.5 - 100 mg). Its performance to predict DDIs with pyrimethamine as OCT2 and MATE1 inhibitor has been evaluated with the transporter substrate metformin.

The original pyrimethamine PBPK model was developed by Sjögren et al. [[1]](https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13020204). Model parameters were refined by Türk et al. [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.2636), to apply the model for renal transporter-mediated DDI predictions. For further details on model development and evaluation, please refer to [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.2636).
